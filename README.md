## 📌 Project Overview
Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing British Airways customer reviews to uncover insights on passenger satisfaction across countries, aircraft types, and time periods.

- Which services have the highest and lowest satisfaction ratings?
- How do ratings vary across aircraft types?
- Which aircraft type offers the best average seat comfort for Economy Class passengers?
- Which aircraft type has the lowest average seat comfort rating in Economy Class?
- **KPIs:** Average rating per metric, number of reviews, rating trends over time.

## 📈 Project Insights
- The Overall Average Rating is the highest at 4.2. Among the service-specific categories, Average Cabin Staff Service is the highest rated at 3.3.
- Cabin Staff received consistently high ratings and entertainment recieved the lowest.
- The two lowest-rated services are Average Entertainment (1.4) and Average Food & Beverages (2.4), indicating critical deficiencies in the onboard product offerings.
- The Airbus A380 has the best average seat comfort rating at 3.1 and Boeing 787 has the lowest average seat comfort rating at 2.3.

 

## ✅ Conclusion
The interactive dashboard provides actionable insights for British Airways to monitor and improve passenger experience across different geographies, aircraft, and service types. It enables data-driven decisions for service enhancements and customer engagement strategies.To maximize customer satisfaction, British Airways must urgently invest in a product overhaul, as the low ratings for Entertainment and Food & Beverages are severely dragging down the passenger experience, despite excellent Cabin Staff Service. A crucial fleet-level fix is also required to standardize comfort by prioritizing the replacement or upgrade of Economy seats on the Boeing 787 to match the better standard set by the Airbus A380.
